TextScrambler-Descrambler-python-
=================================

A very simple text scrambler and descrambler I made in python. It basically takes in a file and scrambles the lines and placing line numbers on them. It can then decramble them back. It was able to sramble War and Peace in about 6 seconds. Decrambling howver took longer :(

call the scramble function with two files, the first being input and the second output. Same with descrambling.
